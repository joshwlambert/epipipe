The goal of epipipe is to document how to build epidemiological pipelines. The 
package contains a set of vignettes which provide explanation of reading 
epidemiological data into R, cleaning steps, and applying epi-methods to the 
data.

The aim is that these vignettes provide modular chunks that explain epidemiological
steps and help user build custom analysis pipelines but copying and pasting 
together the examples we provide. 

_epipipe_ provides and documents _"glue"_ code that links together R packages and methods that
are not natively interoperable.

The _epipipe_ package is a complementary resource to the [The Epidemiological R Handbook](https://epirhandbook.com/en/).
